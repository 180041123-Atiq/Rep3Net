# Rep3Net
Code repository for [paper](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2512.00521). Currently, all the experiments are executed using google colab, that's why only
.ipynb files are available. This repo is primarily based on [DGL LIFE SCI](https://github.com/awslabs/dgl-lifesci). If you have any query, please create an issue, we will try to solve it as soon as possible.
